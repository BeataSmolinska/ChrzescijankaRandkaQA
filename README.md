## Java (Selenium) project

This project contains an automated test responsible for testing the login process on a dating portal using the Java programming language. It is an ongoing project that will be continuously developed and improved. [Here you can see a sample of my code](https://github.com/BeataSmolinska/ChrzescijanskaRandkaQA/blob/main/ChrzescijanskaRandkaQA/src/test/java/chrzescijanksaRandka/testScenarios/LoginTest.java)
